# What does this game do

The game is a classic 2D spaceship game, mainly composed of three parts: a continuously scrolling background, the spaceship, and enemies. The spaceship shoots bullets to take down enemies, and the game ends if an enemy collides with the spaceship or passes by it.

# Why didi I choose this game?

The reason I chose to develop this game is that it's a very classic and fun game. Back when I was in grad 12, I thought I should try to creat this game to improve my Java skills
